# Pattern_Recognition
## Zero
Use of Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify the dry bean dataset, and print out the accuracy of the classifier with general analysis of the dataset.

## One
A script that runs a linear SVM, an SVM with a polynomial kernel, an SVM with a Gaussian kernel, and an SVM with a sigmoid kernel on the dry bean data set.  
Prints out the accuracies for each classifier and includes comments in the script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

## Two
A script that runs two neural network classifiers and two logistic regression classifiers on the dry bean data set, 
one of each with unscaled data and scaled data.  

## Three
A script that runs a Naïve Bayes classifier, a LDA classifier, and a KNN classifier on the Dry Bean dataset, using stratified k-fold validation on the classifiers.  
Prints out the accuracies for each classifier and includes a comment in the script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

## Project
A script that runs 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the dry bean data set, and 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the Cleveland heart dataset, one each with unscaled data and one each with scaled data. 

** Objectives: **
Use of the input models listed below (includes the results from all of these voting classifier on each dataset):
1.	Naïve Bayes 
2.	LDA
3.	KNN 
4.	SVM 
5.	Neural network
6.	Logistic regression

Prints out the accuracy for all 24 individual classifiers and all 4 voting classifiers, and includes a comment block in the script that answers the following questions:

1.	Which of the following achieved higher accuracy?
  a.	The classifier trained on the unscaled dry bean dataset
  b.	The classifier trained on the scaled dry bean dataset
2.	Which of the following achieved higher accuracy?
  a.	The classifier trained on the unscaled Cleveland heart dataset
  b.	The classifier trained on the scaled Cleveland heart dataset
3.	Did any of the individual classifiers achieve higher accuracy than the voting classifiers? If so, list the individual classifier(s) and give a brief explanation of     why/how this occurred.
