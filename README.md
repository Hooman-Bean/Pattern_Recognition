# Pattern_Recognition
## Zero
Use of Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify the dry bean dataset, and print out the accuracy of the classifier with general analysis of the dataset.

## One
A script that runs a linear SVM, an SVM with a polynomial kernel, an SVM with a Gaussian kernel, and an SVM with a sigmoid kernel on the dry bean data set.  
Prints out the accuracies for each classifier and includes comments in the script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

## Two
A script that runs two neural network classifiers and two logistic regression classifiers on the dry bean data set, 
one of each with unscaled data and scaled data.  

## Three
A script that runs a Naïve Bayes classifier, a LDA classifier, and a KNN classifier on the Dry Bean dataset, using stratified k-fold validation on the classifiers.  
Prints out the accuracies for each classifier and includes a comment in the script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

## Project
A script that runs 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the dry bean data set, and 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the Cleveland heart dataset, one each with unscaled data and one each with scaled data.
