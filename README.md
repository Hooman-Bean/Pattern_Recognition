# Pattern_Recognition
Zero
Use of Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify the dataset, and prints out the accuracy of the classifier.

One
A script that runs a linear SVM, an SVM with a polynomial kernel, an SVM with a Gaussian kernel, and an SVM with a sigmoid kernel on the dry bean data set.  
Print out the accuracies for each classifier and include a comment in your script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

Two
A script that runs two neural network classifiers and two logistic regression classifiers on the dry bean data set, 
one each with unscaled data and one each with scaled data.  

Three
a script that runs a Naïve Bayes classifier, an LDA classifier, and a KNN classifier on the Dry Bean dataset, using stratified k-fold validation on at least one of the classifiers.  
Print out the accuracies for each classifier and include a comment in your script on which classifier achieved the best accuracy.

Project
a script that runs 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the dry bean data set, and 2 ensemble voting classifiers on the Cleveland heart dataset, one each with unscaled data and one each with scaled data.
